              <h1>How To Make Jollof Rice</h1>
          </headear>
            <p>"Jollof rice is one of the most common dishes in Western Africa, consumed throughout the regions of Nigeria, Gambia, Senegal, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Togo, Liberia, Mali, Ivory Coast and Southern Cameroons. 
                In Cameroon it is a common favorite at ceremonies such as weddings, graduations and birthdays and is sometimes cooked with "ndole", a local vegetable. 
                There are several regional variations in name and ingredients. 
                The name Jollof derives from the name of the Wolof people, though in Senegal and Gambia the dish is referred to in Wolof as theibou dienne or benachin."

                  <h3>Before you cook Jollof Rice</h3>
                    <li>Prepare the tomato stew. It is advisable to prepare tomato stew before hand and keep in the freezer. 
                        This is so that whenever you want to cook any jollof rice related dish, it is just a matter of adding it to your cooking.</li>
                    <li>If you will use whole chicken then wash and cut it into pieces. Cook with the thyme, Knor seasoning and 2 bulbs of onions (chopped). 
                        The cooking time depends on the type of chicken. The rooster or cockerel cooks much faster than the hen but the hen is definitely tastier. 
                        When done, grill it in an oven. You may also fry it. 
                        This is to give it a golden look which is more presentable especially if you have guests for dinner.</li>
                    <li>Parboil the rice, rinse the parboiled rice and put in a sieve to drain.</li>

                  <h4>Cooking Directions</h4>
                    <li>Pour the chicken stock and the tomato stew into a sizeable pot and leave to boil.</li>
                    <li>Add the drained parboiled rice, curry powder, salt and pepper to taste. The water level should be the same level of the rice. This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked.</li>
                    <li>Cover the pot and leave to cook on low to medium heat. This way the rice does not burn before the water dries up.</li>
